## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Extraction Speed**: ~2-5 seconds per page (depending on image complexity)
- **Character Recognition**: High accuracy for printed text
- **Language Support**: English (can be extended to other languages)
- **File Format Support**: PDF to image conversion supported
- **Processing**: Automatic temporary file cleanup

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **PDF to Image Conversion**: Uses `pdf2image` to convert PDF pages to high-resolution images
2. **OCR Processing**: EasyOCR analyzes each image and extracts text with paragraph detection
3. **Text Structuring**: Organizes extracted text by pages with clear demarcation
4. **Output Generation**: Returns clean, structured text ready for further processing

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The OCR script supports several parameters:

- `dpi`: Image resolution for better OCR accuracy (default: 300)
- `detail`: OCR detail level (0 = text only, 1 = with coordinates)
- `paragraph`: Enable paragraph detection for better text structure

---

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-language OCR support
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple files
- [ ] AI-powered text cleaning and structuring
- [ ] Integration with existing text extraction pipeline
- [ ] Output format options (JSON, XML, structured data)

---

## üìù Notes

- OCR accuracy varies based on image quality and text clarity
- Some character recognition errors may occur with poor quality scans
- Temporary image files are automatically cleaned up after processing
- Processing time depends on document complexity and page count

Feel free to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or new features to enhance the OCR extraction capabilities!
